# Application of Machine Learning in Drug Discovery
I explore different machine learning methods from `scikit-learn` library to predict activity of small molecules as inhibitors of NS1 protein of Influenza A virus. `rdkit` library is also used for handling of molecule strutures and featurization of their struture.

`environment.yml` can be used to create the environment and install the nessary packages. Run the following command in terminal and activate the environment to start.

`conda env create -f environment.yml`
