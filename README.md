# Application of Machine Learning in Drug Discovery
I explore differnt machine learning methods from `scikitlearn` library to predict activity of small molecules as inhibitors of NS1 protein of Influenza A virus. `rdkit` library is also used for handling of molecule strutures and featurization of their struture.

`environment.yml` can be used to create the environment and install the nessary packages. `conda env create -f environment.yml`
